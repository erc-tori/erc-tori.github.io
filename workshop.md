Welcome to the webpage of the [TORI](https://erc-tori.github.io/) Workshop!

# About
The TORI workshop is an **invitation-only**, retreat-style (Dagstuhl-like) workshop on topological methods for data analysis and visualization. It is funded by the [ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/) project [TORI](https://erc-tori.github.io/) and organized to mark the end of this project. Its goal is to summarize and communicate around the major results of the community over the last five years in the fields of topological data description and analysis, and to discuss the most vibrant perspectives for the future.

# Concept
The event is organized as a 3.5 day workshop, with a distinct distinguished keynote each day.
Each day is organized around three 1-hour sessions of short talks (typically, three talks of 15 minutes), with several 1-hour breakouts, to favor informal discussions, meet ups and relaxation.

Lunches and dinners would be provided on site, to also contribute to a friendly and collaborative atmosphere.

# Location

We are currently working towards organizing the workshop on the 
[Opal Cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B4te_d%27Opale), in particular in 
[Wimereux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimereux), which is a beautiful historical seaside resort in the north of France (pictures below). Alternatively, the workshop could be hosted at [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) in Paris.
