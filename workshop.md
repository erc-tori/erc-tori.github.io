Welcome to the webpage of the [TORI](https://erc-tori.github.io/) Workshop!

# About
The TORI workshop is an invitation-only, retreat-style (Dagstuhl-like) workshop on topological methods for data analysis and visualization. It is funded by the [ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/) project [TORI](https://erc-tori.github.io/) and organized to mark the end of this project. Its goal is to summarize the major results of the community over the last five years in terms of topological data description and analysis.
