*Abstract:* Wigner described the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in
the natural sciences: ideas from mathematics are unreasonably effective in
advancing applications, and ideas from applications are unreasonably
effective in advancing mathematics. We describe a case study on persistent
images, a stable vector representation of persistent homology. If you
combine topology with data, you get persistent homology. If you combine
persistent homology with machine learning, you might get persistent
landscapes or persistence images or a host of other options. The first
attempt at persistence images were not stable (i.e. continuous), but by
making them stable, their machine learning performance improves, as we will
describe on examples ranging from materials science to biology. This
ping-ponging behavior of injecting ideas from mathematics, then injecting
ideas from applications, etc, leads to robust applied tools and new
mathematical questions. Joint work with Sofya Chepushtanova, Tegan Emerson,
Eric Hanson, Michael Kirby, Francis Motta, Rachel Neville, Chris Peterson,
Patrick Shipman, and Lori Ziegelmeier.

*Bio:* Henry Adams is an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Colorado State
University. His research interests are in computational topology and
geometry, quantitative topology, combinatorial topology, and topological
data analysis. He has applied topology to problems arising in machine
learning, computer vision, minimal sensing, collective motion models, and
chemical energy landscapes. Professor Adams is the Executive Director of
the Applied Algebraic Topology Research Network (AATRN).
